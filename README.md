# NeuroAid – AI-Powered Neurological Health Companion

## 🚀 Overview
NeuroAid is a research-oriented AI platform that analyzes **speech patterns** to assess neurological health risks such as **Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s**.  
It provides **personalized insights, visualization dashboards, and sharing options** for patients, clinicians, and researchers.

This repository is a **monorepo** containing:
- **Frontend (Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)**  
- **Backend (FastAPI + ML stubs with librosa features)**  
- **Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)**  
- **Infra (Docker Compose, CI/CD, seeds, pre-commit hooks)**

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
- Privacy-first design – data stays local unless explicitly shared.  
- Admin-only access to system metrics.  
- Threat model documented in `/docs/security.md`.

## 📈 Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate real ML models (CNN/RNN on speech datasets)  
- [ ] Add doctor–patient chat interface  
- [ ] Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP) with Kubernetes  
- [ ] Expand to multi-language support
